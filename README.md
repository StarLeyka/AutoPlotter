# AutoPlotter
The project is aimed at creating CNC on the basis of a 2-wheeled car, this will allow to remove the limitations of the XY area and to work in large spaces on flat surfaces of sheet materials. A marker or laser rover can be used as a working tool. The work of AutoPlotter is assumed in the G code, in polar coordinates.
